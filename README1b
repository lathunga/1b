Name: Luke Thunga (I worked alone)

Description: In this part of the project I added the capability to change the nice value
of the called process. This required me to create a new system call "nice" that takes a 
nice value as an argument. I also added a getpstat system call that allows you to fill a
pstat struct with info about the processes.

Files Added:
  - user/getpstat.c (utility program to test getpstat system call)
  - user/nice.c (utility program to test nice system call)

Important Files Changed:
  - kernel/sysproc.c (here is where I put the system calls "nice" and "getpstat")
